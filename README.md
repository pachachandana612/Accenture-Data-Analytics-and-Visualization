# Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization
This is a Simulation project of Accenture North America called "Social Buzz".
# Social Buzz Data Analytics Project

This project, conducted in collaboration with Accenture, involves analyzing and interpreting Social Buzz’s content performance to support their journey toward a successful IPO. Social Buzz, a fast-growing tech company, generates over 36.5 million pieces of content per year, and this analysis aims to provide data-driven insights to identify the top content categories and optimize engagement strategies.

## Project Overview

This project is structured into four main tasks:

### Task 1: Project Understanding
- **Objective**: Gain an in-depth understanding of Social Buzz’s business challenges.
- **Activities**:
  - Meet with Accenture industry experts to review the project brief and understand the client’s business problem.
  - Identify key requirements and tasks to address Social Buzz's content and engagement needs.

### Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling
- **Objective**: Prepare data for analysis to answer Social Buzz's business question.
- **Activities**:
  - Identify relevant datasets (`Content.xls`, `Reactions.xls`, `ReactionTypes.xls`).
  - Clean, preprocess, and merge datasets to ensure data accuracy and completeness.
  - Structure data for analysis to identify the top five most popular content categories.

### Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling
- **Objective**: Communicate findings effectively through data visualizations.
- **Activities**:
  - Select visualizations that best convey the insights about content performance.
  - Create a PowerPoint presentation ([Data Analytics template - Task 3_final.pptx](Data%20Analytics%20template%20-%20Task%203_final.pptx)) to report on Social Buzz’s content engagement metrics and recommendations.

### Task 4: Present to the Client
- **Objective**: Share insights with Social Buzz’s internal stakeholders and Accenture’s project team.
- **Activities**:
  - Record a <10-minute presentation to showcase findings and recommendations for content strategy improvements.
  - Highlight engagement trends, top content categories, and recommended strategies for visual content enhancement.

## Key Findings

- **Top Content Categories**: Animal-themed posts emerged as the most popular.
- **Content Engagement**: Photos and videos lead in engagement, receiving the highest positive sentiment scores.
- **Improvement Opportunities**: GIFs and audio content show higher neutral/negative reactions, indicating areas for optimization.

## Next Steps

1. Scale analysis to monitor real-time content performance.
2. Prioritize visual content in campaigns to enhance user engagement.
3. Investigate further to improve engagement scores for GIFs and audio content.
